# README Generator

![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-74edd1.svg)


## Description üì∞

I was motivated to make this app in order to have an easier way to make README files. Normally I'd have to google a template, copy, paste, and fill it in to my liking. With this app, now I just answer a short question prompt that will take my answers and generate it all into a neat and structured README file.

This solves the problem of time and effort that can now be more focused on actual coding.
In making this, I learned how to invoke (require) different modules, how to pass info both to a function and pass it back into the original instance of the function call (ie: generateMarkdown()). I also got an introduction to new folder structures.

## License üìú
  
This application is covered under the MIT license.
I didn't really use a license. But for the purpose of this assignment, I used this generator, and I think badges look kind of cool, and I like the color I gave it, so, I'm putting it on.
